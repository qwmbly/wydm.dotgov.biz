      Welcome to <strong>WDYM.dotgov.biz</strong>, the official digital arm of the <em>Federal Department of Clarification and Mild Concern</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a citizen expresses confusion with “WDYM,” we respond with swift and increasingly irrelevant clarification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our team of interns is trained in interpretive sarcasm, passive-aggressive helpdesk management, and ancient memeology.
